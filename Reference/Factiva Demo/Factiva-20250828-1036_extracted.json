WHY EUROPEANS HAVE LESS  WHY EUROPEANS HAVE LESS  Sam Bowman  4,116 words  1 October 2025  Reason  RESN  20-26  Volume 57; Issue 5; ISSN:0048-6906  English  © 2025 Reason. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.  EUROPE IS POOR BECAUSE IT CHOOSES TO BE.  IT'S NOT HARD to see why Europeans often feel a sense of superiority over Americans.  No European city has an area as dangerous or decrepit as San Francisco's Tenderloin district. Some  Americans obsess about Europe's supposedly no-go areas, but no European city has crime on par with  places like Memphis, Tennessee, or St. Louis, Missouri. In 2023, more people were murdered in Chicago  (population: 2.7 million) than in all of Italy (population: 59 million). When you ride New York's subways, it's  best not to wear nice shoes in case you step in a pool of vomit.  Our cities are not just vastly safer than America's: They're more beautiful, more vibrant with history and art  and food. Europe has the Tuscan countryside, the Swiss Alps, Barcelona, Provence, the French Riviera, and  the Balearic Islands, all inside an area smaller than Texas.  Europe may be beautiful, but it has become a byword for economic malaise-a land of snooty Europoors who  prostrate themselves before a disdainful President Donald Trump because they aren't sure they can defend  themselves from Russian aggression.  Most of us in Europe don't own ice makers. It can get very hot during our summers, but air conditioning is still  a luxury across the continent. An American friend visiting my house in London was bewildered to see me  hanging my clothes up to dry on a metal hanger in my hallway: Like most Europeans, I don't own a dryer.  The average American could stop working in the first week of October and still will have earned more than the  average Frenchman working until the end of the year. In Western Europe, GDP per capita-the average  economic output per person-is about $63,000 per year, adjusted for the cost of living. In the United States, it  is $86,000.  Yes, Europeans work fewer hours and take more vacation. But that explains only part of the gap.  For roughly two decades, Western Europe, home to the continent's largest economies, has stagnated. In  1995, its labor productivity-the value of goods and services produced per hour worked-was 95 percent of  what it was in the United States, having risen from just 22 percent in 1945. By 2023, it was down to 80  percent. Ten years ago, 52 of the world's top 100 companies by market capitalization were American and 28  were European. Since then, the American total has grown to 58 while the European count has fallen to 18.  The United States has produced five companies worth more than $2 trillion. At around $350 billion, Europe's  largest company, the enterprise software provider SAP, is worth about as much as Home Depot.  Many Europeans assume their lower incomes are the price they pay for ensuring their poorer countrymen  have better living standards. But the median American household has a disposable income that is 16 percent  higher than the median German household, adjusted for purchasing power. Only the poorest 10 percent of  Americans do worse than their French, German, or Italian counterparts in terms of disposable income, which  factors in taxes and welfare.  What explains this gap between Europe and the U.S.? There are many factors, from rigid labor markets to  energy restrictions to trade barriers to burdensome regulations on tech companies. The connecting thread is  that Europe is poor because of specific policy choices. Europe is poor because it chose to be poor.  BIG TECH VS. NO TECH  EUROPE'S MOST OBVIOUS failure is its tech sector. By nearly every measure it lags behind America's, in  an era in which technological progress is one of the strongest drivers of material well-being. Yet rather than  try to emulate America's relatively hands-offapproach, which has given its entrepreneurs, inventors, and  investors the freedom to build such companies as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and Google, the European Union  (E.U.) is known as a \"regulatory superpower.\"",

It went 652 days with an interim government until a new federal government  was formed in 2020. A decade earlier, in 2010, it went 589 days before a government was finally formed.

Belgians turning 65 still retired into a generous pension, pegged to whatever they had earned during their  working lives. The trains kept running, and crime stayed low.  Though the country was rocked by bank failures in 2008- 2009 and the wider eurozone debt crisis that  followed the Great Recession, life has not become radically different for ordinary people over these years.  Taxes and government spending are slowly rising, and GDP growth was an anemic 0.6 percent per year from  2007 through 2023 (half of the rate in the U.S.).

It may be tempting to conclude that Europeans are simply less culturally inclined toward economic dynamism  and growth. Maybe a quiet life is all that Europeans really want.  But this argument is unconvincing. There are, after all, plenty of European tech founders. They just live in  America.

Turnover is thus much higher in America. About 1 percent of the U.S. work force is laid offevery month,  whereas in Germany, less than 0.1 percent is. That makes the cost of risk-taking much higher in Europe than  in the United States. American companies can treat layoffs as a normal if regrettable part of the trial-and-error  process.

Denmark is one of the few European nations that approaches America's GDP per capita adjusted for  purchasing power, and it has one of the continent's highest levels of employment.  These countries also punch well above their weight in high tech. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, which has  pioneered the use of GLP-1 drugs to help with weight loss, has become one of Europe's biggest companies.  Sweden's Spotify is one of Europe's only successful consumer technology platforms.  Rigid labor market laws have another drawback. The more difficult it is to hire and fire workers, the harder  immigrants tend to find it to assimilate into their new country's job market-and the more they resort to low-paid  informal work that they can get through social and family connections. This reduces how much exposure they  get to people from their new country's native population, which makes them less likely to adjust to, and adopt,  the country's values.

More flexible labor market laws  might not just add vitality to Europe's economies; they could help address one of the continent's biggest  social problems.  THE HIGH COST OF ENERGY  IN 2003, ENERGY prices in America and in Europe's largest economies were similar. But by 2021-before  Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent European energy prices even higher-German industrial electricity prices  were 156 percent of what American industrial users were paying. Spanish industrial customers were paying  twice the American price. In 2021, Italian businesses, who have long faced high prices, paid four times as  much for electricity as American ones. In Europe's largest economies, energy prices were nearly twice as  high as American prices before the Ukraine war.  The price of natural gas has shot up since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driving energy costs even higher.  One in 10 Europeans reported not being able to keep their homes warm enough during the winter of 2023. In  2022, when energy prices were at their highest, factories across the continent were forced to furlough their  workers and pause production.  But it is a mistake to blame Europe's energy problems solely on the war, as some do. Natural gas was cheap  during the 2010s: lower in nominal terms in 2015 than it had been 10 years earlier, and falling even more by  the end of the decade. But even as gas prices fell, electricity prices rose.  The biggest reason is probably   climate   policy. European governments and the E.U. have committed the  continent to an exceptionally demanding decarbonization schedule that runs far ahead of those of the United  States or China. By 2030, European emissions must be at least 55 percent below where they were in 1990.  National governments that do not act to bring this about can be prosecuted.  Compare this to America, which merely seeks a nonbinding 50 percent to 52 percent reduction in emissions  below its 2005 peak, which was higher than in 1990. China doesn't even plan for emissions to start falling  until after 2030. Europe adopted a carbon pricing system in 2005. It now charges about six times more per  ton of carbon than China does, and about 50 percent more than California. Most U.S. states do not price  carbon emissions at all.",

From 2000 to 2020, European countries cut their coal use by more than half, and from 2010 to 2021 they shut  down 80 gigawatts' worth of coal-fired power plants. Along with gas, most of the shortfall was made up by  wind and solar, both of which are significantly subsidized by levies on energy bills.  Many European states have responded to these high prices by subsidizing electricity for large users. As well  as raising costs for other energy users, this has the effect of making it harder for smaller companies to  compete with their larger rivals. Since such policies are unlikely to be sustainable for very long, they do little  to keep these sectors going in the long run. The continued investment and entry they require depends on  returns over a long time horizon.  High energy costs have led to rolling sectoral recessions. A recent report into European competitiveness by  former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi estimated that output in Europe's four largest energy-intensive  sectors-chemicals, basic metals, minerals, and paper-has fallen by over 10 percent in the past four years,  following the rise in gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will cost half a trillion euros to  decarbonize just these sectors. Decarbonizing shipping and aviation will cost a further 100 billion euros per  year.  Yet Europe's leaders have generally refused to accept that its green energy policies are this costly. Even the  Draghi report, held by many to be the first serious attempt to acknowledge the continent's economic  problems, claims that decarbonization is an opportunity \"to take the lead in new clean technologies and  circularity solutions.\" But Europe's eagerness to take the lead on decarbonization is the source of many of its  troubles.  HIDDEN TRADE BARRIERS  IF EUROPE'S PROBLEMS were limited to national policy errors, then in time you would expect economic  activity to flow to islands of relative openness, such as Sweden and Denmark, just as bad policies in  California and New York have driven people to Florida and Texas.  That might even be how the E.U. is supposed to work. Its single market is often seen as the E.U.'s crowning  achievement: a set of rules that are supposed to ensure the frictionless movement of goods, services, capital,  and people across the borders of Europe's member states.  But Luis Garicano, an economist and former member of European Parliament, argues that the single market  has been leftto decay-and sometimes has actually become a barrier to trade by adding new regulations on  top of existing ones.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping law governing data use and privacy, is  interpreted and enforced differently in each member state. In practice, this means that compliance with the  law varies wildly across the bloc. Ireland, for example, approved Meta's data protection practices. But  German and French GDPR regulators disagreed and levied fines of 390 million euros on the company. New  antitrust powers introduced to govern Big Tech companies have been layered on top of national-level antitrust  enforcement, creating multiple enforcers and contradictory sets of rules for the same conduct.  This pattern repeats itself for every other flagship E.U. regulation, and is built into the design of the new AI  Act. In total, the Union now has 270 different technology regulators. The Draghi report estimates the direct  costs of rules being duplicated like this is some 200 billion euros per year.  In other cases, the single market has simply been leftunfinished. Professional qualifications, for example, are  not recognized across European borders-when engineers based in Portugal win a contract for work in  Germany, they face lengthy bureaucratic \"equivalency checks\" that stop them in practice from performing the  work. National environmental regulations block products that are safely produced and used across the rest of  the continent. Many important sectors, like finance and energy, are excluded from the single market  altogether.  The number of lawsuits brought against governments for single market infringements-the bread and butter of  enforcing European free trade-has collapsed under the E.U.'s current leadership. Thierry Breton, who was  internal market commissioner until last year, was supposed to work on breaking down these trade barriers but  focused instead on fights with U.S. tech CEOs and stewarding the continent's AI regulations.  This is hugely significant for Europe's economy. Trade within the E.U. is vast, and making it even slightly  easier could have enormous benefits. The International Monetary Fund estimates that barriers to trade within  the E.U. are equivalent to a 44 percent tariffon goods and a 110 percent tariffon services. According to  Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist of the French bank BNP Paribas, \"it would only take a 2.4 per cent  increase in intra- EU trade to make up for a 20 per cent fall in exports to the US.\"  This might also be a reason Europe's tech companies have struggled: Unlike their American or Chinese  rivals, they do not have a large domestic market to sell into.",

BASEL EXPOSITION  FOR ALL OF Europe's longrunning economic problems, it was only after the Great Recession that the  continent's economy really began to flatline. Meanwhile, America's recovered and continued to grow.  What accounts for this sharp difference in performance? Tyler Goodspeed, former acting chair of the U.S.  Council of Economic Advisers, points to the Basel III financial regulations, global rules set out after the 2008  financial crisis. These were intended to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis by curbing lending to  businesses and requiring banks to hold more \"safe\" assets.  Whether these measures actually increase financial stability is questionable, given that earlier iterations  required banks to hold more mortgage debt than they wanted. With the Great Recession, that came to look  like a mistake.  Though the postcrisis Basel rules were adopted in the United States as well, their effect in Europe may have  been particularly chilling for business lending. There are two reasons for that.  One: Europe's banking system is much more consolidated than America's. The United States has thousands  of smaller banks, which escape many of the strictest rules. European countries tend to be dominated by only  a handful of much larger institutions.  Two: Europe's businesses are far more dependent on bank lending for financing than America's are. In  Europe, 68 percent of business financing comes from banks, compared to just 20 percent in the United  States. America's much larger venture capital, private equity, and pension fund investors make restrictions on  bank lending much less important than in Europe.  Debt financing generally favors capital-intensive businesses, such as Sweden's H2 Green Steel, which raised  4.2 billion euros in debt last year to finance a hydrogen-fired steel mill. Softwarebased companies, which  have little collateral to borrow against, tend to find it harder to get loans this way.  This isn't a problem in Silicon Valley, which has access to America's $1.25 trillion in venture capital. If  Goodspeed is right, Basel's tighter rules on lending could be a big reason that European startups have  struggled to grow compared to their American peers. Fixing the problem need not mean adding more risk to  European finance: Removing barriers to the sort of investments that American companies can access could  be the answer.  IS EUROPE DOOMED?  THERE ARE ISLANDS of success across the continent. The Dutch company ASML is the world's only  manufacturer of the photolithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors.

Over the course of my lifetime, the U.S. population hasrisen from 160 million to 342  million and the world population has grown from 2.6 billion to 8.1 billion.  Still, given current trends, demographers calculate that world population will likely peak at just over 10 billion  later in this century and then start to fall. Why? Because people are choosing to have fewer children. The  total fertility rate- thatis, the number of children the average woman has over the course of her lifetime-has  been falling for decades. On a global scale, it has dropped from 5 kids in the 1960s to 2.2 children now. In the  U.S., the rate has fallen from around 3.6 in 1960 to 1.6 today. That is well below the population replacement  rate of 2.1 children per woman.  Even if Musk's end-of-civilization worries are a bit hyperbolic, should we be concerned about impending  depopulation? In After the Spike, the economic demographers Dean Spears and Michael Geruso argue,  somewhat persuasively, that we should.  The book's first section shows that current fertility trends will yield a spike in population followed by  accelerating population decline. Since many people still believe that a world with fewer people is worth  pursuing, the authors next turn to dismantling the case against more people.  The most infamous modern prophet of population doom is the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich. In his 1968  bestseller, The Population Bomb, Ehrlich proclaimed that the \"battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the  1970's the world will undergo famines-hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of  any crash programs embarked upon now.\" Instead of that doomsday scenario, farmers deploying modern  tech have boosted the number of daily calories per person by more than a third since the 1960s. Instead of  rising death rates, global life expectancy rose from 57 yearsin 1968 to 73 years now.  Spears and Geruso comprehensively demolish Ehrlich's doomsaying. They fully acknowledge that human  activities have harmed the natural world, but they make a strong case that human ingenuity is addressing  such environmental concerns as man-made   climate   change and declining biodiversity. \"The data tell us that  lives are better now than lives were in the past-even though there are many more lives around. Fears of a  depleted, overpopulated future are out-of-date,\" they rightly conclude.  So why are birth rates falling all over the world? The authors knock down the conventional hypothesis that  rising monetary costs are to blame. The real costs of children, they argue, are the opportunity costs: \"what a  potential parent would be ready to give up to have an extra child.\" The seductions of the modern world  include higher paying work, longer vacations, restaurant meals, sports, video games, innumerable  on-demand entertainment options, and so forth. \"Once we see that costs include opportunity costs, as life  becomes richer and more rewarding, children cost more,\" they say. \"Even if we eliminated every dimension of  social inequality and unfairness between women and men, the opportunity cost of having a child would still be  greater in the richer, freer, better-entertained future than it was in the past.\" And as demographic history  shows, fewer and fewer people are willingto pay those costs.  The authors fear a depopulating world will bring permanent economic and social stagnation. More people  mean more ideas, and more ideas mean increasing abundance and better solutions to problems. \"Without",

One problem: Contemporary high-fertility groups  today have lower fertility than in their own pasts. They too are tracing the downward slope toward  belowreplacement fertility.  Despite these policy failures, Spears and Geruso worry that demagogues will use concerns over low birth  rates to pursue unsavory agendas \"of inequality, nationalism, exclusion, or control.\" While they strongly  believe that \"it Would be better if the world did not depopulate,\" they also defend reproductive freedom.  \"Nobody should be forced or required to have a baby (or not to have ababy),\" they maintain.

Background  Innovation readiness is crucial for transformative changes and enhanced performance in health care and  depends on multiple factors including trust, training, and unit dynamics.  Purposes  We develop and validate a survey measuring innovation readiness in health care organizations, focusing on  dispositional, situational, and learned dimensions. We identify individual and unit factors that constitute  innovation readiness.  Methodology/Approach  We administered a survey assessing individual (e.g., autonomy at work) and unit (e.g., unit innovation  climate ) characteristics to 593 intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians across four ICUs (50.3% response). We  used principal component analysis with varimax rotation to assess psychometrics and t tests to examine  groups' differences.  Results  Psychometric analysis detected seven factors; five multi-item factors, namely, trust in technology, concerns  about technology, unit innovation   climate , unit manager commitment to technology, and professional identity  assessing innovation readiness; four factors with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from 0.79 to 0.90; and two  individual single-item factors measuring unit human–technology interdependence and unit training on  technology. Individual and unit factors related to technology innovation readiness differed by professional  discipline, unit, and tenure.  Conclusion  The survey exhibited reliability in four ICUs in one hospital, suggesting that this 21-item tool can be used in  similar settings. Variation in innovation readiness among professional disciplines and units highlights the  importance of tailored approaches when introducing new technologies.  Practice Implications  Managers can use this survey to gauge readiness and address individual and unit needs before implementing  new technologies. Future research should validate this tool in diverse health care contexts to expand the  literature on technology innovation readiness.  Document HCMR000020250820ela100008",

Tax Evasion Determinants and Effect in Urban Ghana: The Case of Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly  Tax Evasion Determinants and Effect in Urban Ghana: The Case of Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly  Ronald Ebenezer Essel  11,327 words  1 October 2025  Public Administration Quarterly  SRP  164-186  Volume 49; Issue 3; ISSN:0734-9149  English  © 2025 Public Administration Quarterly.

Introduction  Background  The offering of social/collective/public good, communal benefits, amenities, and infrastructure constitutes a  fundamental role of governments across the globe. The capability of a government to furnish sufficient  communal benefits heavily relies on the mobilization of revenue through taxation. Recently, the task of  generating ample tax revenue to support communal benefits in Ghana has proven to be difficult, given the  majority (approximately 86%) of employed Ghanaians operate within the informal/underground/shadow  economy (Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], 2012). The presence of a substantial amount of informal sector  operators in Ghana contributes to a heightened level of tax evasion since a significant number of informal  operators do not register their businesses for their activities to be regulated and they also refrain from  registering with the Ghanaian tax regulatory and monitoring authority, that is, Ghana Revenue Authority  (GRA) vis-a-vis tax recognition, determination, evaluation, and mobilization.  Tax evasion, as defined by Wenzel (2002), refers to the illicit circumvension of taxes by trust, corporations,  and private individuals. This illicit practices often involves taxpayers intentionally misrepresenting the true  state of their affairs to tax authorities with the aim of reducing their tax obligations. It covers fraudulent tax  declaration, like downplaying income, earnings, or gains in contrast to the real amounts acquired, or  overstating deductions. An indicator of the degree of levy evasion (referred to as “tax lacuna”) represent  undeclared earning volumes, indicating the variance between the income that should have been reported to  tax authorities and the factual reported amount.  Asante (2012), utilizing the Stock-Watson Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) estimation for currency  demand, revealed that, the unreported tax in Ghana linked to the shadow economy during the period  1990–2010 varies from 4% to approximately 14%. Terkper (2013) also projected that, among the  approximately 1 million, 500,000 citizens of Ghana taxpayers subject to income taxes, the informal sector’s  contribution constitutes merely 5% of that total. Indeed, these studies suggest that, the expansive scale of the  informal economy in Ghana present a challenge to the mobilization of levy receipt. As per Danquah and  Osei-Assibey (2018), Ghana experiences a loss of approximately 69.5% in its possible incomes on levies due  from the underground economy as a result of non-compliance to levy payments. Furthermore, they identified  a tax gap of approximately US$57 million within Ghana’s informal economy. Moreover, as per World Bank  (2020), disparity in Value Added Tax and noncompliance of levies spans from approximately 18% to 39%,  whereas the corporate profit tax gap is approximated to be about 81%.  Ghana maintains a corporate income tax rate of 25%, contrasting with rates of 30%–35% in certain other  African nations. With the passage of the Value Added Tax, (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 2022 (Act 1087), the VAT  has been increased from 12.5% to 15%. The Communications Services Tax is levied at a rate of 6% on fees  for the utilization of mobile, internet, and tele exchange facilities in Ghana. Importation tariff rates fluctuate  between 0% and 20%, contingent on classifications in the harmonized code. Indirect taxes are typically  applied according to the ex-factory price of commodities and fluctuate between 10% and 17.5%, depending  on the nature of the goods. Direct levies are also comparatively modest, with a marginal tax rate set at 25%  for income exceeding GH ₵ 1,350 per month for resident individuals.  Other main tax types charged in Ghana using Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) categorization include  stamped duty, charged on transaction values; airport tax charged on flight passengers; national fiscal  stabilization levy, charged on pre-tax profit in selected sectors; minerals royalties, charged on revenues from  mineral sales; petroleum taxes, charged on petroleum purchases; National Health Insurance Levy, charged  on all taxable sales and Ghana Education Trust Fund Levy, charged on all taxable.  While conventional benefactor backing that has traditionally financed a substantial portion of state  expenditure in emerging economies, has been dwindling over the period, dependence on aid from the",

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development-(IBRD)  has been criticized for their strict terms and negative outcomes. These challenges underscore the imperative  for developing nations such as Ghana to address levy lacunas, reducing their dependence on external  funding sources and shifting toward utilizing local levy incomes/resources for their infrastructural endeavors.  Various factors have the potential to influence nonobservance of levies within the clandestine economy in  Ghana, as expounded by diverse theoretical viewpoints. The traditional economics proposition/model of  anticipated satisfaction suggests that changes in levy adherence/nonadherence stem from factors such as  tax inspections, sanctions, and tax tariffs. Conversely, propositions/principles/models like the prospect-based  decision hypothesis, ethics, and fairness principle argue that the noncompliance with tax responsibilities is  shaped by aspects such as societal standards, ethics, perceptions of impartiality, and confidence. In an  endeavor to counter tax dodging, Ghana has initiated tax modifications to revamp her taxation systems with  the objective of achieving heightened proceeds or enhancing the flexibility and resilience of the  scheme/structure of levy (Osei & Quarter, 2005). The execution of these levy restructurings revealed  numerous strategies to mobilize tax revenues within the informal sector.  While the ongoing discussion regarding the correlation between tax avoidance and pecuniary advancement in  numerous emerging countries is a thoroughly examined subject in economics and finance, the inquiry  findings are mixed and heterogeneous (Amoh et al., 2023). Within the existing empirical literature in  accounting, finance, and economics, three distinct empirical conclusions regarding the connection between  levy noncompliance and national progression/advancement exist. These are direct/affirmative (Aumeerun et  al., 2016), indirect/adverse (Amoh et al., 2023), and no or negligible correlation (Eichorn, 2004).  Researchers have asserted that irrespective of the viewpoint/methodology adopted by any investigation in  examining levy noncompliance, a thorough comprehension of levy noncompliance is highly important.  However, the factors impacting levy avoidance remain a debatable and unsettled matter (Kira, 2017).  Consequently, this research aims to evaluate tax evasion as a behavioral process intrinsic in value  generation activities, breaking it down into constituent phases and assessing its influential ramifications on  the Ghanaian economy, with a focus on the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly (LMA).  The assumption is that a comprehensive comprehension of the procedures implicated in tax avoidance,  alongside the elemental phases, would foster a deeper appreciation and a vivid identification of the levy  noncompliance procedure, assisting in the development of reliable, efficient policy choices to prevent the  phenomenon in Ghana. Hence, this current research carried out a factor examination (specifically exploratory  factor examination [EFA]) of levy noncompliance by embracing the levy evasion supply-chain framework,  covering proceeds submission (RET), earning declaration (DSC), levy obligation calculations (CMP), and tax  payment (PM).  Therefore the aim of this study is to explore the four aspects of tax avoidance (RET, DSC, CMP, and PM)  within the framework of a transformative lower-middle income West African emerging country, south of the  Sahara (Ghana) for levy management in LMA, situated in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. The primary  aspect (RET) relates to the filing of returns, which are obligatory procedures for every taxpayer and involve  the collection, organization, and return of a taxpayer’s trading, profit and loss accounts for a given  assessment period to GRA. Secondly, there is DSC, which involves disclosing relevant details about a  taxpayer’s income for a specific assessment year.  The Income Tax Act, 2015 (Act 896) mandates that information provided regarding a taxpayer should  encompass the origin of income received during the assessment year, the sum of income acquired during the  assessment year, the income amount from each origin, and particulars concerning expenses, tax holidays,  breaks, exemptions, concessions, subtractions, and depreciation subtractions. Thirdly, CMP involves  calculation of levy obligations, entailing the assessment of the sum owed by the levy contributor for a specific  assessment period as delineated in the pertinent levy laws. This entails computing the total sum of income  and expenses that are legally assessable, permissible in addition to addressing protestations, petitions, and  disagreements that may emerge during the procedure. Fourthly, PM is the settlement of outstanding taxes,  encompassing the actual gathering, retrieval, and reimbursement. Once an assessment attains finality and  conclusiveness, the entire sum of the owed tax must be remitted within the designated timeframe.  Purpose of the Study  The purpose of this inquiry is to empirically investigate the impact of tax evasion on the Ghanaian economy,  with a focus on the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly (LMA), one of Ghana’s 261 Metropolitan, Municipal, and  District Assemblies (MMDAs).

Research Questions  Following the research objectives outlined above, the study’s research questions are formulated and  enumerated as follows:  *  i. How are taxes evaded in Ghana?  *  ii. What are the mechanism/means to curb tax evasion in Ghana?  *  iii. What are the effect of levy noncompliance on the economy of Ghana?  Research Hypotheses  This current study’s main hypothesis was formulated based on the it’s underpinning theory, that is, The  Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and evidences in the existing empirical literature as follows:  *  Hypothesis 1 (H1): Tax evasion has a negative influence on Ghana’s economy.  It must be however noted that the constituents of tax evasion so far as this current study is concerned are the  levy evasion supply-chain framework, covering return filling (RET), income disclosure (DSC), tax liability  computation (CMP), and tax due payment (PM).  Contribution/Novelty  This research contributes to the extant literature by providing detailed, context-specific insights into the  determinants and effects of tax evasion in a lower-middle income West African emerging economy, south of  the Sahara (urban Ghana), concentrating specifically on the Ledzekuku Municapal Assembly, one of Ghana’s  261 MMDAs. Its novel approach and focus offer valuable empirical evidence and practical recommendations  for policymakers and researchers interested in understanding and addressing tax evasion challenges in  similar urban context, enriching the broader discourse on tax evasion and fiscal policy. Additionally, the  inquiry’s conceptual framework, even though country-specific (Ghana) can be replicated in other similar  emerging market economies thus adding to knowledge in the extant literature, strengthening the study’s  contribution, methodically, conceptually, and theoretically.  Article Organization  The rest of the study is organized into five sections. Section “Literature Review” discusses the theoretical  framework within which the study is conducted and reviews the relevant empirical literature on the  phenomenon under investigation. Section “Conceptual Framework (Research Model)” focused on the  research methodology employed for the study. Section “Results” concentrated on the presentation and  discussion of the study results/findings whilst Section “Conclusion” concludes with policy implications,  limitations, and suggestions for further research.  Literature Review  Theoretical Review  The theoretical foundations (philosophical perspectives, conceptions, paradigms, models, and theories)  underpinning research on tax evasion in the economics/accounting/finance extant literature include but not  limited to the expected utility theory (EUT), prospect theory (PT), theory of planned behavior (TPB), equity  theory (ET), attrition theory (AT), compliance theory (CT), the Expectancy theory (EXT), The Benefits theory  (BT) among other economics, psychological, and sociological theories.

However, the contemporary economic  framework for examining tax evasion is commonly attributed to the groundbreaking work of Allingham and  Sandmo (1972), that was patterned after Becker’s (1968) pecuniary perspective on criminal activity. In 1972,  economist Martin Allingham and Agnar Sandmo independently developed what is known as the  Allingham-Sandmo model, which is the foundation for analyzing tax evasion behavior.  Allingham & Sandmo’s 1972 paper, “Income Tax Evasion: A Theoretical Analysis,” is a seminal work in  economics exploring the economic and behavioral aspects of income tax evasion. The authors developed a  rational choice model wherein individuals weigh the benefits and costs of tax evasion, considering potential  legal penalties if caught. They emphasized the importance of deterrence, where higher probabilities of  detection and severity of penalties discourage tax evasion. The paper also discussed the impact of tax  amnesties on tax compliance. While influential in shaping subsequent research in behavioral economics and  public finance, the Allingham-Sandmo model has been critiqued for its inability to address fluctuations in tax  rates. Scholars like Yitzhaki (1974) and Pencavel (1979) expanded the model by integrating labor supply  decisions and making audit probabilities endogenous, enhancing our understanding of tax evasion dynamics.  Gary Becker’s (1968) paper, “Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach,” is a significant contribution to  economics as it applies economic principles to analyze criminal behavior. Becker introduces rational choice  theory, suggesting that individuals weigh the costs and benefits of engaging in crime before deciding. He  views crime as a rational decision aimed at maximizing utility, where benefits include material gains and costs  encompass the risk of punishment and legal expenses. Becker emphasizes deterrence, linking its  effectiveness to the severity and certainty of punishment. He also introduces the concept of “human capital”  in understanding criminal behavior. This present study is grounded on the expected utility theory as the  philosophical paradigm underpinning the study.  Underpinning Theory—The Expected Utility Theory (EUT)  The EUT has several key contributors who played significant roles in its development. The theory evolved  over time with contributions from different scholars such as Bernoulli (1738), von Neumann and Morgenstern  (1953), and Savage (1954). These three scholars are often considered the primary proponents who laid the  foundation for the EUT. The theory has since been refined and extended by various economist, decision  theorists, and scholars in related fields. Despite its foundational role, the EUT has faced criticism and  challenges, leading to the development of alternative theories such as PT to better explain decision-making  under uncertainty.  Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), a Swiss mathematician, is often considered the originator of the EUT. His work,  “Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk (1738),” laid the foundation for the theory by  introducing the idea that people derive satisfaction not directly from wealth but from the utility associated with  it.  John von Neumann (1903–1957) and Oskar Morgenstern (1902–1977), were mathematicians and  economists who collaborated on the groundbreaking work “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior  (1953).” They extended the concept of utility to decision-making under uncertainty, introducing the EUT as a  means to model rational decision-making in uncertain situations. Leonard J. Savage (1917–1971), an  American mathematician and statistician, made significant contributions to the formalization and development  of the EUT. His book “The Foundations of Statistics (1954)” contributed to the understanding and application  of probability and utility decision theory.  The EUT offers the fundamental economic structure for examining noncompliance of levy. It represents a  paradigm of choice-making in situations of unpredictability. The taxpayer’s choice to engage in tax evasion or  abstain relies on optimizing the expected utility of evading taxes, carefully considering the advantages of  successful deceit versus the uncertain likelihood of been caught and penalized (Allingham and Sandmo,  1972). This implies a levy contributor selects among engaging in evasion or refraining from it depending on  their satisction preference. Pecuniary and monetary factors commonly referenced in literature on tax evasion  include audit tax rate (random audits), risk-based audits, information reporting, whistleblower programs,  international cooperation, and digitalization and data analytics etc., as well as the perceived seriousness of  penalties.  Overview of Taxation in Ghana  As per Randolph (2011), the inception of revenue generation in Ghana dates back to 1943.

However, the contemporary economic\nframework for examining tax evasion is commonly attributed to the groundbreaking work of Allingham and\nSandmo (1972), that was patterned after Becker’s (1968) pecuniary perspective on criminal activity. In 1972,\neconomist Martin Allingham and Agnar Sandmo independently developed what is known as the\nAllingham-Sandmo model, which is the foundation for analyzing tax evasion behavior.\nAllingham & Sandmo’s 1972 paper, “Income Tax Evasion: A Theoretical Analysis,” is a seminal work in\neconomics exploring the economic and behavioral aspects of income tax evasion. The authors developed a\nrational choice model wherein individuals weigh the benefits and costs of tax evasion, considering potential\nlegal penalties if caught. They emphasized the importance of deterrence, where higher probabilities of\ndetection and severity of penalties discourage tax evasion. The paper also discussed the impact of tax\namnesties on tax compliance. While influential in shaping subsequent research in behavioral economics and\npublic finance, the Allingham-Sandmo model has been critiqued for its inability to address fluctuations in tax\nrates. Scholars like Yitzhaki (1974) and Pencavel (1979) expanded the model by integrating labor supply\ndecisions and making audit probabilities endogenous, enhancing our understanding of tax evasion dynamics.\nGary Becker’s (1968) paper, “Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach,” is a significant contribution to\neconomics as it applies economic principles to analyze criminal behavior. Becker introduces rational choice\ntheory, suggesting that individuals weigh the costs and benefits of engaging in crime before deciding. He\nviews crime as a rational decision aimed at maximizing utility, where benefits include material gains and costs\nencompass the risk of punishment and legal expenses. Becker emphasizes deterrence, linking its\neffectiveness to the severity and certainty of punishment. He also introduces the concept of “human capital”\nin understanding criminal behavior. This present study is grounded on the expected utility theory as the\nphilosophical paradigm underpinning the study.\nUnderpinning Theory—The Expected Utility Theory (EUT)\nThe EUT has several key contributors who played significant roles in its development. The theory evolved\nover time with contributions from different scholars such as Bernoulli (1738), von Neumann and Morgenstern\n(1953), and Savage (1954). These three scholars are often considered the primary proponents who laid the\nfoundation for the EUT. The theory has since been refined and extended by various economist, decision\ntheorists, and scholars in related fields. Despite its foundational role, the EUT has faced criticism and\nchallenges, leading to the development of alternative theories such as PT to better explain decision-making\nunder uncertainty.\nDaniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), a Swiss mathematician, is often considered the originator of the EUT.

The direct introduction of such taxes failed due to weaknesses in the tax collection system and the misuse of  the initial revenues collected.  This marked the commencement of taxation in Ghana, with subsequent significant amendments in tax laws  over the years. The Income Tax Ordinance, the first direct levy law, was instituted in 1943. Aligned with the  existing Direct Levy Act in the UK, the Ghanaian tax ordinance primarily imposed taxes on income sourced  within Ghana, exempting foreign-sourced income unless remitted in Ghana. The ordinance included various  personal reliefs and deductions as integral components.  From its establishment, direct tax statutes in Ghana has undergone numerous alterations and adaptations.  An illustration of this is the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance 1952. The original unified edition of the  Income Tax Ordinance was released in March 1953, subsequently undergoing revisions in Acts 68 (1961),  178 and 197 (1963), and Act 312 (1965). The second revised edition, Tax Decree 1966 (No. 78), was  released in September 1966. Additionally, the third consolidated version, the Income Tax Decree 1975  (SMCD [Supreme Military Council Defense] 5), was introduced in December of 1975. In 2000, the  government enacted fresh levy regulations to improve the management of direct levies, wealth tax, and  transfer tax in the country, contributing to an overall enhancement in tax administration in the nation.  Empirical Literature and Hypothesis Development  A thorough analysis of the evidences in the extant economics/finance/accounting empirical literature indicates  that, three main themes emerges vis-à-vis the influence of noncompliance of levies on socio-economic  advancement of nations.  Whilst certain inquiries revealed a negative/indirect association between levy noncompliance and economic  progression of nations (Amoh et al., 2023; Bethencourt & Kunze, 2019), others revealed a positive/direct  association between the two phenemena (Aumeerun et al., 2016), while still other researches revealed no  significant impact or no relationship at all between levy noncompliance and economic advancement of  nations (Eichorn, 2006).  The “enhance the process” proposition ideally confirms the direct relationship with respect to levy  nonobservance and national advancement, whereas the “hinder the process” proposition provides a rationale  for the indirect/opposite association concerning levy nonconformity and national progression. The “enhance  the process” and “hinder the process” propositions offer a valid justification for the link between levy  nonconformity and national advancement in this inquiry, as scholars argued that tax noncompliance  constitutes a form of misconduct.  In reality, the levy reviews and the imposition of penalties demonstrates important indicators of tax avoidance.  An investigation conducted in 2008 by Ken Devos concerning behaviors linked to levy noncompliance as well  as population characteristics factors utilizing a research approach in Australia. The inquiry specifically  stressed the link with respect to levy contributors’ understanding of levy outcomes and the influence of those  outcomes on decisions about levy conformity through population factors. That investigation revealed a  notable indirect association with respect to the apparent severity of lawful consequences and decisions  concerning levy adherence.  In the analysis by Lewis et al. (2009), intellectual and ethnic variances in complying with levy statutes in Great  Britain and Italy were examined, revealing that in Italy, levy noncompliance is discouraged by the apparent  possibility of exposure and notification. Researchers observed that levy noncompliance cannot be entirely  accounted for by economic factors alone and remains supplemented by psychosomatic and societal  elements.  Batrancea et al. (2012) investigated tax non-compliance behavior under the influence of tax law complexity  and the relationship between taxpayers and authorities in Romania. The study concluded that, tax  non-compliance is triggered by high complexity of tax law derived from excessive regulation, use of abstract  and complex legal jargon, as well as constant changes of the Fiscal Code. Concerning the relationship  between taxpayers and authorities, non-compliance is fostered by an antagonistic   climate   in which mutual  distrust and the promotion of a “cops and robbers” attitude toward taxpayers prevail.  Nichita et al. (2012) analyzed tax compliance behavior from the tax morale standpoint, and offered a broader  view on the influence of tax morale on compliance behavior, covering published research articles ranging  from national and cross-cultural surveys to experimental games. The study concluded by offering policy  implications of tax morale research and the changes governments could make in order to raise the amount of  public levies.  In an European study, Kogler et al. (2013) tested the slipery slope framework of tax compliance integrating  different determinants of tax compliance in four European countries differing in terms of cultural and  economic settings (Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Russia) by presenting participants with different  scenarios of trust and power.

In addition, participants in  conditions of high trust indicated more voluntary compliance just as participants in conditions of high power  indicated higher enforced compliance. The present results support the assumptions of the slippery slope  framework and confirm the role of trust and power as important determinants of tax compliance.  Batrancea et al. (2019) tested the slippery slope framework of tax compliance/noncompliance using data from  an experimental scenario study in 44 nations from 5 continents(N = 14,509). The study found that trust in  authorities and power of authorities, as defined in the slippery slope framework, increase tax compliance  intentions and mitigate intended tax evasion across societies that differ in economic, sociodemographic,  political, and cultural backgrounds. The study also showed that trust and power foster compliance through  different channels: trusted authorities (those perceived as benevolent and enhancing the common good)  register the highest voluntary compliance, while powerful authorities (those perceived as effectively  controlling evasion) register the highest enforced compliance. In contrast to some previous studies, the  results suggest that trust and power are not fully complementary, as indicated by a negative interaction effect.  Despite some between-country variations, trust and power are identified as important determinants of tax  compliance across all nations.  Employing a flexible intersecting framework for levy nonconformity, Bethencourt and Kunze (2019)  investigated the opposite correlation concerning levy nonadherence and national advancement. In  accordance with the inquiry, levy nonconformity exhibited an indirect correlation with national progress.  Omodero (2019) investigated the pecuniary consequences of levy nonadherence and the informal economy  in Nigeria, utilizing previously collected data and ordinary least squares regression analysis spanning  1991–2018. The findings of the study revealed that tax nonadherence was found to have a significantly  adverse impact on economic progress in Nigeria.  Amoh and Adafula (2019), employing the ARDL proposition based on the cash demand analysis, conducted  an examination to estimate the extent of tax avoidance from the magnitude of the “informal economy” in  Ghana. The study determined that Ghana possesses a substantial “hidden sector” and encounters a  significant occurrence of levy nonadherence. The condition in Ghana has been exacerbated by a factor  stimulating the hidden economy, namely mobile money transactions, which accounted for 83.1% of the gross  domestic product for that financial, fiscal, and accounting year. Conclusions from the scientific inquiry  revealed that the amplified frequency of electronic payment transactions contributes to the exacerbation of  the tax nonadherence issue in Ghana. Throughout the research period, tax evasion constituted an average of  20.78% of Ghana’s GDP.  In another investigation in Nigeria, Olabisi et al. (2021) explored the tax conformity supply chain amongst levy  contributors in Nigeria, specifically Lagos township. Employing a statistical/mathematical research strategy  and utilizing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on four tax nonadherence value chain elements namely RET,  DSC, CMP, and PM. Conclusions drawn from the inquiry revealed that levy adherence is a composite worth  that necessitates dissection and examination of its components. Additionally, it suggested that tax adherence  should be deconstructed into distinct phases of value creation for effective monitoring.  Batrancea et al. (2022) investigated the differences in declared tax evasion attitudes between students and  entrepreneurs under the slippery slope framework of tax compliance using students and entrepreneurs from  Warsaw Poland. The study utilized diverse circumstances to influence the two constructs of the framework,  trust in authorities and power of authorities (high vs. low trust; high vs. low power), in an imagined country  named Varosia. After reading one of the four scenarios, economics and finance students and entrepreneurs  from Poland reported their tax compliance intentions. Tax evasion attitudes were different for entrepreneurs  and students. Results indicated that students were more prone to tax evasion but this effect could be  mitigated by particularly increasing the power of authorities.  Conversely, for entrepreneurs, trust in authorities had a stronger impact on tax compliance than enforcement.  Low tax morale was a significant predictor of high tax evasion in both groups.  Batrancea et al.

In addition, participants in\nconditions of high trust indicated more voluntary compliance just as participants in conditions of high power\nindicated higher enforced compliance. The present results support the assumptions of the slippery slope\nframework and confirm the role of trust and power as important determinants of tax compliance.\nBatrancea et al. (2019) tested the slippery slope framework of tax compliance/noncompliance using data from\nan experimental scenario study in 44 nations from 5 continents(N = 14,509). The study found that trust in\nauthorities and power of authorities, as defined in the slippery slope framework, increase tax compliance\nintentions and mitigate intended tax evasion across societies that differ in economic, sociodemographic,\npolitical, and cultural backgrounds. The study also showed that trust and power foster compliance through\ndifferent channels: trusted authorities (those perceived as benevolent and enhancing the common good)\nregister the highest voluntary compliance, while powerful authorities (those perceived as effectively\ncontrolling evasion) register the highest enforced compliance. In contrast to some previous studies, the\nresults suggest that trust and power are not fully complementary, as indicated by a negative interaction effect.\nDespite some between-country variations, trust and power are identified as important determinants of tax\ncompliance across all nations.\nEmploying a flexible intersecting framework for levy nonconformity, Bethencourt and Kunze (2019)\ninvestigated the opposite correlation concerning levy nonadherence and national advancement. In\naccordance with the inquiry, levy nonconformity exhibited an indirect correlation with national progress.\nOmodero (2019) investigated the pecuniary consequences of levy nonadherence and the informal economy\nin Nigeria, utilizing previously collected data and ordinary least squares regression analysis spanning\n1991–2018. The findings of the study revealed that tax nonadherence was found to have a significantly\nadverse impact on economic progress in Nigeria.\nAmoh and Adafula (2019), employing the ARDL proposition based on the cash demand analysis, conducted\nan examination to estimate the extent of tax avoidance from the magnitude of the “informal economy” in\nGhana. The study determined that Ghana possesses a substantial “hidden sector” and encounters a\nsignificant occurrence of levy nonadherence. The condition in Ghana has been exacerbated by a factor\nstimulating the hidden economy, namely mobile money transactions, which accounted for 83.1% of the gross\ndomestic product for that financial, fiscal, and accounting year. Conclusions from the scientific inquiry\nrevealed that the amplified frequency of electronic payment transactions contributes to the exacerbation of\nthe tax nonadherence issue in Ghana. Throughout the research period, tax evasion constituted an average of\n20.78% of Ghana’s GDP.\nIn another investigation in Nigeria, Olabisi et al. (2021) explored the tax conformity supply chain amongst levy\ncontributors in Nigeria, specifically Lagos township. Employing a statistical/mathematical research strategy\nand utilizing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on four tax nonadherence value chain elements namely RET,\nDSC, CMP, and PM. Conclusions drawn from the inquiry revealed that levy adherence is a composite worth\nthat necessitates dissection and examination of its components. Additionally, it suggested that tax adherence\nshould be deconstructed into distinct phases of value creation for effective monitoring.\nBatrancea et al. (2022) investigated the differences in declared tax evasion attitudes between students and\nentrepreneurs under the slippery slope framework of tax compliance using students and entrepreneurs from\nWarsaw Poland. The study utilized diverse circumstances to influence the two constructs of the framework,\ntrust in authorities and power of authorities (high vs. low trust; high vs. low power), in an imagined country\nnamed Varosia. After reading one of the four scenarios, economics and finance students and entrepreneurs\nfrom Poland reported their tax compliance intentions. Tax evasion attitudes were different for entrepreneurs\nand students. Results indicated that students were more prone to tax evasion but this effect could be\nmitigated by particularly increasing the power of authorities.\nConversely, for entrepreneurs, trust in authorities had a stronger impact on tax compliance than enforcement.\nLow tax morale was a significant predictor of high tax evasion in both groups.\nBatrancea et al. (2022) employing the frequentist and Bayesian analyses, investigated the slipery slope\nframework’s assumptions on a sample of 2,786 self-employed taxpayers from eleven post-commu-nist and\nnon-post-communist countries doing business in five economic branches.

Additionally, self-employed taxpayers from\npost-communist countries reported higher intended tax compliance and lower tax evasion than those from\nnonpost-communist countries.\nKogler et al.

Findings from the study revealed that both trust and power are  indirectly associated to the size of the subterranean economy and the extent of corruption. These results  emphasize the importance of both slipery slope framework’s dimensions in fighting levy non-compliance and  counterproductive behavior within a society in general.  Mazurenko et al. (2023) scrutinized the influence of taxpayers’ covert levy avoidance on the competitiveness  of the levy systems of eleven European nations spanning 2011–2021. Employing multivariate regression, the  inquiry established that underground production, occupation, and entrepreneurship were the predominant  tactics for tax avoidance.  Based on the computed results, regression models were devised to illustrate the effect of underground levy  avoidance on the competitiveness of the levy systems at the national level. The research revealed that  Slovenia (0.32), Romania (0.34), and Croatia (0.26) were the countries where shadow levy avoidance exerted  the most significant influence on tax competitiveness. Conversely, the tax system competitiveness of the  Czech Republic (0.096) was the least responsive to shadow tax avoidance.

Employing PLS-SEM to analyze a dataset divided into quarters spanning 1996–2020, the study  uncovered that both revenue mobilization efforts and tax nonadherence exert adverse impacts on the  Economic Freedom Index but beneficial effects on urbanization. The findings also indicated that  organizational superiority moderated the association concerning levy nonconformity and national  advancement in Ghana.  Kumi et al.

Utilizing  data on regularized crop protection traders in Ghana and adopting probit regression to estimate factors  influencing tax conformity, while utilizing the weighted regression adjustment model inversely to assess the  influence of tax compliance on business performance, the study found that oldness and sex demonstrate a  positive correlation with compelled tax conformity, whereas schooling directly influences intentional levy  adherence. However, the levy percentage, conviction, and once-a-month earnings show a positive  association with voluntary tax compliance but a negative effect on compelled tax conformity.  Conversely, while the authority’s power has a negative effect on voluntary compliance, it positively influences  compelled tax conformity, corroborating the Slippery Slope Framework.  Ackom (2023) examined the impact of tax nonconformity on Ghana’s economic progress from the viewpoint  of the private sector. The study findings indicated that both in the short and long term, the business sector  displays a significant association with advancement. Furthermore, tax avoidance has considerable immediate  and prolonged effects on development. Additionally, it was deduced that policymakers should concentrate on  establishing a resilient macroeconomy and strengthening institutions to promote the progress of the private  sector. To stimulate growth and advancement, it is essential to implement tax measures that facilitate the  prosperous expansion of new businesses.  Wiafe et al.

The  projected levy nonadherence attributed to the existence of the hidden sector averages around 6.28% of GDP.

Author’s Construct (2024)  [Figure omitted. See PDF]  Methodology  Inquiry’s Design/Approach/Philosophy  The inquiry espoused a sequential explanatory research design (research design), employing a  mixed-method research approach (research approach) to analyze and address the research  objectives/questions/hypotheses, taking its guided roots from the pragmatism philosophical paradigm  (research philosophy), that make use of both quantitative (PCA, EFA, CFA, PLS-SEM) and qualitative (case  study) methodological techniques. Sequential explanatory research design involves collecting and analyzing  quantitative data first, followed by qualitative data to provide additional insights, explanations, or context to  the quantitative findings.  This approach aims to complement or elaborate on quantitative results by exploring the underlying meanings,  experiences, or processes associated with the phenomena under investigation. Sequential explanatory  research design is particularly useful in situations where quantitative data alone may not provide a complete  understanding of complex phenomena. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods in a sequential  manner, researchers can leverage the strengths of both approaches to generate more robust and nuanced  findings. This approach enhances the validity, depth, and richness of the research findings, ultimately  contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic.  Given the objectives underlying the present inquiry on the effect of tax evasion on Ghana’s economy, a  sequential explanatory research design, employing both quantitative and qualitative techniques was  considered suitable.  Study Area—Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly-(LMA)  This study investigates the effect of levy noncompliance on Ghana’s national progression and advancement,  focusing on LMA. The LMA is one of Ghana’s 261 MMDAs and is part of the 29 MMDAs in the Greater Accra  Region, the region that host Accra, Ghana’s capital. Initially, it was an element of the now non-operational  Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal Assembly, which was established on 29th February 2008 (emanating from the  Accra Metropolitan Assembly in 1988). Nonetheless, on 15th March 2018, a section of the assembly was  detached to form the Krowor Municipal Assembly. Subsequently, the residual portion was renamed as the  LMA. Hence, in 2007, the Local Government Legislative Instrument of 1989 (LI 1500) was repealed with the  publication of LI 1865 (2007) which instituted the LMA.  Established under the Legislative Instrument (LI 1865), the LMA, situated with its Administrative Capital in  Teshie, encompasses an approximate land area of 47.57510 square kilometers. The topmost partisan and  executive powers within the Metropolitan area is held by LMA. The role of the political and executive leader of  the Assembly is assumed by the Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE). According to Section 20 (2) of Act 462,  the MCE is designated as the chairperson of the executive committee of the assembly. The day-to-day  implementation of both executive and administrative functions of the assembly, including the oversight of its  various departments, is supervised by the MCE. Additionally, the MCE is designated as the primary  representative of the Central Government in the Metropolis. Assisting the MCE in the daily administration of  the Assembly is the Municipal Coordinating Director (MCD), who holds the position of the Head of Civil  Service in the Metropolis.  As at 2021, the LMA had a population of 217,304 inhabitants, with an age range of 15–64, which is within the  workforce of 64.6% of the population. The 2010 Population and Housing Census results revealed that, the Ga  tribe form the predominant ethnic group in the Municipality, with the Ewe following as the second-largest  group. Additionally, various other ethnicities, such as Akans, Kasena, Grusi, Nkonya, Busanga, and  numerous other tribes, are also present in the Municipality. The Ledzokuku Municipality has a number of  public health facilities which serves the inhabitants and its neigbouring environs including Lekma hospital,",

See PDF]\nMethodology\nInquiry’s Design/Approach/Philosophy\nThe inquiry espoused a sequential explanatory research design (research design), employing a\nmixed-method research approach (research approach) to analyze and address the research\nobjectives/questions/hypotheses, taking its guided roots from the pragmatism philosophical paradigm\n(research philosophy), that make use of both quantitative (PCA, EFA, CFA, PLS-SEM) and qualitative (case\nstudy) methodological techniques. Sequential explanatory research design involves collecting and analyzing\nquantitative data first, followed by qualitative data to provide additional insights, explanations, or context to\nthe quantitative findings.\nThis approach aims to complement or elaborate on quantitative results by exploring the underlying meanings,\nexperiences, or processes associated with the phenomena under investigation. Sequential explanatory\nresearch design is particularly useful in situations where quantitative data alone may not provide a complete\nunderstanding of complex phenomena. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods in a sequential\nmanner, researchers can leverage the strengths of both approaches to generate more robust and nuanced\nfindings. This approach enhances the validity, depth, and richness of the research findings, ultimately\ncontributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic.\nGiven the objectives underlying the present inquiry on the effect of tax evasion on Ghana’s economy, a\nsequential explanatory research design, employing both quantitative and qualitative techniques was\nconsidered suitable.\nStudy Area—Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly-(LMA)\nThis study investigates the effect of levy noncompliance on Ghana’s national progression and advancement,\nfocusing on LMA. The LMA is one of Ghana’s 261 MMDAs and is part of the 29 MMDAs in the Greater Accra\nRegion, the region that host Accra, Ghana’s capital. Initially, it was an element of the now non-operational\nLedzokuku-Krowor Municipal Assembly, which was established on 29th February 2008 (emanating from the\nAccra Metropolitan Assembly in 1988). Nonetheless, on 15th March 2018, a section of the assembly was\ndetached to form the Krowor Municipal Assembly. Subsequently, the residual portion was renamed as the\nLMA. Hence, in 2007, the Local Government Legislative Instrument of 1989 (LI 1500) was repealed with the\npublication of LI 1865 (2007) which instituted the LMA.\nEstablished under the Legislative Instrument (LI 1865), the LMA, situated with its Administrative Capital in\nTeshie, encompasses an approximate land area of 47.57510 square kilometers. The topmost partisan and\nexecutive powers within the Metropolitan area is held by LMA. The role of the political and executive leader of\nthe Assembly is assumed by the Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE). According to Section 20 (2) of Act 462,\nthe MCE is designated as the chairperson of the executive committee of the assembly. The day-to-day\nimplementation of both executive and administrative functions of the assembly, including the oversight of its\nvarious departments, is supervised by the MCE. Additionally, the MCE is designated as the primary\nrepresentative of the Central Government in the Metropolis. Assisting the MCE in the daily administration of\nthe Assembly is the Municipal Coordinating Director (MCD), who holds the position of the Head of Civil\nService in the Metropolis.\nAs at 2021, the LMA had a population of 217,304 inhabitants, with an age range of 15–64, which is within the\nworkforce of 64.6% of the population. The 2010 Population and Housing Census results revealed that, the Ga\ntribe form the predominant ethnic group in the Municipality, with the Ewe following as the second-largest\ngroup. Additionally, various other ethnicities, such as Akans, Kasena, Grusi, Nkonya, Busanga, and\nnumerous other tribes, are also present in the Municipality. The Ledzokuku Municipality has a number of\npublic health facilities which serves the inhabitants and its neigbouring environs including Lekma hospital,",

Study Population  This study target population is made up of all persons living within the LMA. Nevertheless, an accessible  population (sampling frame) for the purposes of this study, is made up of all eligible taxpayers (persons  actively engage in productive economic activity or working, who are eligible to pay tax) operating within the  LMA.  Sampling Procedure and Sample Size  The study employed a non-probabilistic/non-random sampling method, specifically convenience sampling, to  determine a sample size of 300 survey participants, made up of individuals undertaking economic activity  within the LMA eligible to pay tax. The sample size of 300 was selected based on the mathematical  expression of standard error of the Mean (Malhotra, 2008) as follows:  n = ( σ ) 2 × Z 2 D 2 = ( . 4418 ) 2 ( 1 . 96 ) 2 05 2 = 299 . 9325 ~ 300  (n represents sample size; σ denote standard deviation [roughly = 0.4418]; Z is standardized error associated  with a 95% confidence level aligned with 1.96 on the standard normal z-table and D is degree of accuracy  [0.05].) A final number of 285 surfaced as the resulting sample size following the exclusion of inappropriate  surveys containing lost information and logical mistakes, resulting in a respondent response rate of 95%, an  indication that the investigation does not suffer from non-response bias.  Convenience sampling technique was used because the researcher’s interest was to investigate the influence  of levy noncompliance on the Ghanaian economy, focusing on individuals undertaking economic activity  within the LMA. However, the researcher does not have access to the study’s sampling frame, that is, a list of  all individuals undertaking economic business activity within the LMA, eligible to pay tax to the local  authorities and central government from which the sample size could be drawn probabilistically or randomly.  This was the reason why a non-random/non-probabilistic sampling technique was espoused for the study.  Convenience sampling is the method frequently employed in studies of this nature (R. E. Essel, 2020, 2022,  R. Essel 2021), as it involves selecting individuals who are readily accessible and willing to participate in the  research during data collection (the sample for the study was determined based on favorable circumstances).  Data Collection Instruments  The present research employed firsthand sources of information to collect primary data from participants.  This research employed self-administered survey questionnaire with a structured format distributed to 300  participants through on-the-spot data collection method. The survey questionnaire consist of two segments.  Segment one gathered respondent’s personal data.  Segment two collected data on the theorized/hypothesized tax evasion factors/constructs/dimensions, namely  RET–represented by four items/questions; DSC–composing of four items/questions; CMP–made up of four  items/questions; and tax PM–constituting four items/questions in addition to seven itemized questions on the  impact of levy noncompliance in Ghana; all totaling 23 items/questions. The twenty-three (23) questionnaire  items were designed on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from one (NOT at all true), two (SOMEWHAT true),  three (NOT sure), four (SOMEWHAT true), and five (TOTALLY true). Using an average mark approach, all  questions were consolidated into solitary marks based on identified constructs.

Reliability and Validity  The study explanatory constructs recorded Cronbach’s α values higher than Hair et al (2016) endorsed  threshold, that is, 0.7 and as such deemed acceptable. The study recorded Cronbach’s α values of .92, .86,  .89, .93, and .94 for RET, DSC, CMP, PM, and tax evasion effect on the Ghanaian economy (ETE),  respectively, with a combined value for all five factors of 0.91. The study also recorded composite reliabilities  (CR) figures higher than Hair et al (2016) recommended criteria, that is, above 0.7 and as such the study is  deemed to have sufficient internal consistency. The research attained convergent validity as it registered  substantial (greater than 0.5) and numerically substantial factor loadings.  The study also accomplished discriminant validity since the created average variance extracted (AVE) for all  proven explanatory constructs were juxtaposed with the squared correlation concerning those constructs and  the other constructs.  The study also secured discriminant validity since the square root of the AVE value calculated for all proven  constructs displayed on the slanting/transverse/diagonal figures surpassed their correlations with other  dimensions, that is, the off-crosswise figures. The research generated AVE square root figures over and  above the inter-dimension correlational figures, as illustrated in Table 2. In addition, since all the variance  inflation factor (VIF) values fell below the standard criterior of 10, the extracted factors/constructs/dimensions  utilized as explanatory variables did not have any issues of multicollonearity (Kennedy, 1998: R. Essel and  Addo, 2021).  Table 2.

SD represents standard deviation; Cronbach’s a-(alpha) is a measure of reliability-(internal  consistency); CR represents composite reliability, another measure of reliability-(internal consistency) and an  indicator of the shared variance among the observed variables used as a pointer of a latent construct; AVE  represents Average variance extracted, a primary/direct convergent validity measure (evident by high-[above  0.5] AVE values) and an indirect measure of discriminant validity, construct validity and content validity;  Significant high factor loadings signifies/support convergent validity; JB represent Jarque-Bera test, a  statistical test used to determine whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal  distribution. All items are 5-point Likert scales, anchored by “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”  Measurement Model Estimation  The study questionnaire scale as presented in Appendix 1 was evaluated via first order CFA using maximum  likelihood estimation methodology. This necessitated that, the variables under study be continuous variables  and they should exhibit the characteristics of normally distributed continuous variables so as to ensure the  validity and reliability of the survey scale items. The study recorded large and substantial standardized factor  loadings that surpassed Hair et al. (2016) standard of 0.70. All conventional constructs demonstrated internal  consistency recording Cronbach’s α and composite reliability values higher than Hair et al. (2016) criterion of  0.7. Furthermore, the AVE generated figures higher than Hair et al. (2016) threshold of 0.5 as presented in  Tables 2 and 4, indicating that a larger portion of the difference is elucidated.  Common Method Variance (CMV) Diagnostics  Considering the singular data collection approach applied in the research (i.e., the utilization of a  structured/closed-end survey questionnaire), Harman’s one-factor test, following Podsakoff et al. (2003)  methodology, was employed to evaluate the presence of common method variance (CMV) bias prior to  conducting any statistical inferential analysis, specifically PLS-SEM Path Analysis. As depicted in Table 5, the  absence of CMV bias is apparent, as the highest total variance associated with a single factor does not  exceed the 50% threshold recommended by Hair et al., 2016 (The study observed a maximum total variance  of 30.10%).

Hypotheses Testing: PLS-SEM via Structural Path Analysis  PLS-SEM was utilized to examine the postulated connections among the levy evasion value chain analysis  model, encompassing returns filling (RET), information disclosure (DSC), computations of due levy (CMP),  and tax due payment (PM). As shown in Table 7, all theorized, four tax evasion value chain constituents  whole structural paths were validated, as the four predictive dimensions—RET (beta of −.213, t = 4.11, p <  .01), DSC (beta of −.401, t = 5.73, p < .01), CMP (beta of −.202, t = 3.85, p < .05), PM (beta of −.238, t =  4.01, p < .01)—all demonstrated a substantial negative/adverse impact/influence on Ghana’s economy  developmental progress.

Examining Respondents’ RET Status  As part of investing objective one, that is, how taxes are evaded in Ghana, the researcher ascertained  whether the respondents file their tax returns periodically with the appropriate tax authority, that is, GRA.  Responses harnessed from the study participants revealed that, 214 out of the 285, representing 75.08% do  not file their tax returns periodically, some due to non-awareness (139%–64.95%) and the rest (75%–35.05%)  due to self-unwillingness to file their tax returns. The remaining 71 (24.92%) participants did reveal that, they  file their tax returns periodically.  Examining Participants’ Knowledge of the Requirement to Disclose their Income to Ta Authorities  The study also investigated whether respondents were aware of the need to declare or report their  incomes/earnings (or any other required information) and whether they actually do declare their  incomes/profits to the GRA. Responses gathered from the respondents indicated that, 79 out of the 285,  constituting 27.7%, periodically disclose their incomes/earnings in addition to any other mandatory",

Author’s (2024).\nHypotheses Testing: PLS-SEM via Structural Path Analysis\nPLS-SEM was utilized to examine the postulated connections among the levy evasion value chain analysis\nmodel, encompassing returns filling (RET), information disclosure (DSC), computations of due levy (CMP),\nand tax due payment (PM). As shown in Table 7, all theorized, four tax evasion value chain constituents\nwhole structural paths were validated, as the four predictive dimensions—RET (beta of −.213, t = 4.11, p <\n.01), DSC (beta of −.401, t = 5.73, p < .01), CMP (beta of −.202, t = 3.85, p < .05), PM (beta of −.238, t =\n4.01, p < .01)—all demonstrated a substantial negative/adverse impact/influence on Ghana’s economy\ndevelopmental progress.\nTable 7.\nHypothesis Test Results\nStructural linkages β path coefficients t-statistics p-values Results\nH1: RET → ETE −.213 4.11 .01 Supported\nH2: DSC → ETE −.401 5.73 .01 Supported\nH3: CMP → ETE −.202 3.85 .05 Supported\nH4: PM → ETE −.238 4.01 .01 Supported\nSource.

R2 = .68, adjusted R2 = .66; F-value = 32.65.\nExamining Respondents’ RET Status\nAs part of investing objective one, that is, how taxes are evaded in Ghana, the researcher ascertained\nwhether the respondents file their tax returns periodically with the appropriate tax authority, that is, GRA.\nResponses harnessed from the study participants revealed that, 214 out of the 285, representing 75.08% do\nnot file their tax returns periodically, some due to non-awareness (139%–64.95%) and the rest (75%–35.05%)\ndue to self-unwillingness to file their tax returns. The remaining 71 (24.92%) participants did reveal that, they\nfile their tax returns periodically.\nExamining Participants’ Knowledge of the Requirement to Disclose their Income to Ta Authorities\nThe study also investigated whether respondents were aware of the need to declare or report their\nincomes/earnings (or any other required information) and whether they actually do declare their\nincomes/profits to the GRA. Responses gathered from the respondents indicated that, 79 out of the 285,\nconstituting 27.7%, periodically disclose their incomes/earnings in addition to any other mandatory",

Examining Respondents’ Honesty in Tax Payment Computation  The inquiry again, probed whether respondents honestly and accurately compute the required amount of tax  to be paid to the GRA.  Information collected from the respondent showed that, whereas 100 respondents, representing 35.08%  indicated that they do honestly and accurately compute the right amount of tax required to be paid to the  GRA, 185, constituting 64.92%, indicated that they do not compute the correct amount of tax in view of the  fact that, they are not abreast with the computation methodology and procedures.  Examining Respondents’ Honesty in the Payment of Tax Due  The study also reconnoitered whether respondents honestly pay their due tax in full and on time to the GRA.  Feedbacks generated from the respondents indicated that, 75 out of the 285, constituting 26.32%,  periodically and honestly pay the correct amount of tax due to the GRA, with the remaining 210, representing  73.68% not paying the correct/accurate tax due to the GRA.  Examining Respondents’ Views on the Effect of Tax Evasion on the Ghanaian Economy  The study participants were requested to provide their concise viewpoint regarding the impact of levy  noncompliance on the Ghanaian economy. One hundred and seventy one out of the 285, representing 60%  of the respondents admitted that tax evasion reduces government revenue. Fourteen out of the 285,  representing 4.91% indicated that tax evasion may compel government to reallocate resources from  productive investments to cover budget shortfalls. Twenty-two out of the 285, constituting 7.71% were of the  view that, tax evasion worsens existing challenges and can hinder progress in poverty reduction, education,  and healthcare. Fifteen out of the 285, forming 5.26% revealed that tax evasion weakens the sense of civic  duty and social responsibility. Seventeen out of the 285, constituting 5.96% were of the opinion that tax  evasion causes lack of confidence in the tax system and the overall governance of the Ghanaian economy.  Thirty-one out of the 285, representing 10.87% opined that tax evasion creates an uneven playing field in the  business environment, giving an unfair advantage to the tax evader. Last but not the least, 15 out of the 285,  forming 5.26% contended that tax evasion may result in an increase in tax rates on compliant taxpayers to  make up for the revenue shortfall. It is indicative from the responses of the respondents that, they are  conscious of the detrimental consequences (negative impact) of tax evasion on the Ghanaian economy’s  progress.  Discussion  Feedback from study participants reveals that tax evasion mechanisms within the LMA in Ghana include  RET, DSC, CMP, and PM. The study’s significant finding is that majority of the respondents (ranging from  65% to 75%) engaged in various forms of tax evasion, such as not filing tax returns, not disclosing incomes,  dishonestly computing tax liabilities, and not paying the correct amount of tax due to authorities. These  actions aim to increase profitability and retain more cash for the tax evaders, ultimately hindering Ghana’s  developmental progress. This aligns with Beattie’s (1970) empirical view that business individuals seek  wealth maximization, often leading to tax evasion as a means of reducing tax liabilities.  Table 7 highlights that RET has a significantly negative impact on Ghana’s economic growth/development,  indicating that individuals/firms within the LMA who fail to periodically file tax returns contribute to reduced  government revenues. These lost revenues could otherwise have been used for socioeconomic development  projects in Ghana. Additionally, RET emerged as the third most influential predictor of tax evasion in Ghana,  with a beta value of −.213. This finding is consistent with previous studies by Syafriel (2018).  The study’s findings reveal a significantly negative impact of DSC on Ghana’s socioeconomic  growth/development, with a beta value of −.401.  This indicates that businessmen within the LMA who fail to disclose accurate incomes or report vital  information to the GRA contribute to reduced government tax revenues. DSC emerged as the first and most  influential predictor of tax evasion in Ghana, aligning with previous research by Windanaputra et al. (2019)  and Syafriel (2018).  Table 7 clearly illustrates that CMP and PM have substantial negative impacts on Ghana’s developmental  progress. This suggests that individuals or entrepreneurs operating within the LMA, especially those in the  shadow/informal economy, who inaccurately compute their tax liabilities contribute to reduced government  revenues. These lost revenues could have been allocated to poverty reduction, education, healthcare, and  other crucial projects. However, CMP is the least potent predictor of tax evasion, with a beta value of −.202,  while PM emerges as the second most influential predictor, with a beta value of −.238.",

(2019), indicating the  significant impact of tax evasion on Ghana’s economic growth and development.  Conclusion  This study examined the influence of levy noncompliance on the Ghanaian economy. The research  concentrated on the LMA. The research deployed a quantitative research approach, utilizing both descriptive  statistics like mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, Jarque Berra test and inferential statistical  techniques like PLS-SEM structural path analysis for testing the study’s hypothesis. The study concluded  that, all the four tax evasion constituents acting as explanatory variables had statistically significant negative  effect on the Ghanaian economy, with income disclosure being the most influential predictor of tax evasion.  These findings suggest that inefficiencies and non-compliance in these areas are critical drivers of tax  evasion in urban Ghana.  In addition, it can be inferred that levy noncompliance significantly impacts the foundations of the Ghanaian  economy as levies constitute a substantial portion of government levy proceeds.  Key Findings  *  Return Filling (RET): Accurate and timely filing of tax returns is crucial for ensuring that taxpayers’ obligations  are transparent and properly recorded. However, lapses in return filling have been identified as a significant  contributor to tax evasion.  *  Income Disclosure (DSC): The disclosure of actual income is essential for determining the correct tax liability.  The study reveals that inadequate income disclosure is the most potent predictor of tax evasion, indicating a  widespread issue of underreporting income.  *  Tax Liabilities Computation (DSC): Proper computation of tax liabilities ensures that taxpayers understand  their obligations. Errors or intentional miscalculations in this area also significantly contribute to tax evasion.  *  Tax Due Payment (PM): Ensuring that taxes due are paid on time is fundamental to the integrity of the tax  system. Delays or failures in making due payments are a key factor in tax evasion.  Given the substantial negative impact of tax evasion on the economy, several policy measures are  recommended to address this issue:  *  Tax Awareness Campaigns: Implementing extensive tax awareness campaigns through various media  channels can educate taxpayers about their obligations and the benefits of compliance. Raising awareness  can lead to improved voluntary compliance and reduced tax evasion.  *  Penalties for Tax Evaders: Strengthening and enforcing penalties against tax evaders can act as a deterrent.  Clear, consistent, and stringent penalties can discourage individuals and businesses from attempting to  evade taxes.  *  Enhanced Review and Assessment Procedures: Incorporating thorough review and assessment procedures  into the tax framework can help identify discrepancies and areas prone to evasion. This includes regular  audits and assessments to ensure compliance.  *  Targeted Tax Audits: Conducting tax audits in specific areas known for high evasion rates can help uncover  and address tax avoidance practices. These audits should be systematic and cover both individuals and  businesses.  *",

Cedefop: Launch of the European Vocational Teacher Survey (EVTS)  Cedefop  Cedefop: Launch of the European Vocational Teacher Survey (EVTS)  526 words  24 September 2025  Insight EU Events (IEU-E)  IEUEV  English  Copyright 2025. Comecon Media GmbH  On 25th September 2025, at the   Fourth Policy Learning Forum , Cedefop will launch the   European Vocational  Teacher Survey (EVTS) . This groundbreaking initiative designed to fill crucial knowledge gaps about  vocational education and training (VET) teachers across Europe, will focus on teachers’ skill gaps,  professional development needs and overall working conditions in initial VET (IVET) schools.  Why the survey and why now?  The EVTS aims to provide policymakers with robust, comparable data that can improve IVET teachers’  professional development and better prepare them for major socioeconomic challenges, such as the AI  transition,   climate   change, and the need to reduce social exclusion amongst students. By doing so, the  survey will directly support the EU’s overarching goals to cultivate a high-quality teaching workforce capable  of preparing learners for inclusive, digital, and green transitions. Ultimately, the findings will contribute to  tackling persistent teacher shortages and making VET teaching a more attractive profession across Europe.  The EVTS will gather insights from approximately 14,000 randomly selected teachers, both vocational and  general education subjects, in initial VET schools (ISCED level 3) across 23 European countries, and namely  Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania,  Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and  Sweden.  What teachers will share  Participating IVET teachers will complete a 30-minute online questionnaire, delving into critical areas,  including:  * Professional growth: how teachers enhance their skillsets and develop professionally.  * IVET teachers’ skill gaps: with a particular focus on new digital and green technologies, and their abilities in  managing inclusive learning environments.  * Impact of continuing professional development (CPD): the effectiveness of various professional  development activities in updating teachers’ skills.  * Workplace realities: job satisfaction, working conditions, and the overall attractiveness of VET teaching  profession.  * Drivers and barriers influencing participation in CPD.  Ensuring quality and trust  The methodology ensures scientific rigour. Schools and teachers are randomly selected following a robust  scientific methodology to make the survey representative of VET teachers’ experiences across Europe.  Participation is entirely voluntary and confidential, with all collected data being anonymised and used strictly  for research purposes to protect individual privacy. The questionnaire has undergone extensive development,  including translatability assessment, cognitive testing and pilot testing, to ensure clarity, consistency and  international comparability.  By gathering such detailed and comparable data, the EVTS aims to directly shape better policies at both  national and EU levels. These insights will ensure that IVET teachers have access to impactful professional  development, directly supporting the EU’s vision for a high-quality teaching workforce and enhancing  European competitiveness. Beyond policy, the insights gained from the survey will be shared with  participating schools, offering valuable data to enhance their professional development programmes for  teachers and their teaching strategies.",

ACER webinar on improving EU scenario development to meet future energy needs  ACER  ACER webinar on improving EU scenario development to meet future energy needs  244 words  10 September 2025  Insight EU Events (IEU-E)  IEUEV  English  Copyright 2025. Comecon Media GmbH  ACER is organising a webinar to present the findings of a consultancy study on improving scenario  development for two core EU energy planning processes:  * the Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDPs) by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG; and  * the European Resource Adequacy Assessment (ERAA) by ENTSO-E.  When & where?  * Thursday 11 September 2025, from 10:00 to 11:00 (CEST), online.  What is the event about?  Scenario development plays a key role in long-term energy planning and adequacy assessments.  Strengthening the quality and alignment of scenarios across different EU planning processes is key to  supporting the EU’s decarbonisation goals and guiding timely investments that help drive Europe’s energy  transition.  To support this, ACER commissioned a study in November 2024 to analyse key challenges in how scenarios  are developed for the TYNDP and ERAA, and how national energy and   climate   plans (NECPs) are reflected  in these scenarios. The study, which will be published in late August 2025, provides a set of  recommendations to improve scenario-building practices by strengthening consistency, transparency and  stakeholder engagement.  Why should you join?  This webinar offers an opportunity for policymakers, regulators, system operators and other stakeholders  involved in EU energy infrastructure and adequacy processes to:  * gain insights into the study’s main findings;  * understand current gaps in scenario development; and  * explore practical recommendations to improve the quality and consistency of energy scenarios.
